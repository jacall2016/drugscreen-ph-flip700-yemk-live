Drug Screen Analyzer
Description:

Drug Screen Analyzer is a Python program designed to analyze sensor data from Drug screen Excel files. 
The program processes the input data and exports Excel files containing the analyzed results. It provides a convenient tool for extracting valuable insights from Drug screen sensor data.

Instalation
1. clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jacall2016/drugscreen-ph-flip700-yemk-live.git

# Overview

I am trying to learn better tecneques for writing data analysis programs so that I can brouden my feild of expertiese.

the data I am using comes from the E241 BNSN | Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
Brigham Young University | Provo UT 84604

the drug screen data is currently held in excel sheets. the purpose of this project is to analyise the data to provide a comprehensive dataset which will be accessable to the public. because the data has not yet been fully compiled I will provide a set of links to examples data sets that will be analyized to Eventually produce the comprehensive data set.

the purpose of this software is to fasilitate the fast analysis of the drug screen data. The purpose of the drug screen is to identify compound of intrest to find areas of future study. Of particular intrest are compounds which have a harmful effect upon the cells which in this analysis are refered to as hits. These compounds may be possible future medications to combate the african sleeping sickness

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

question 1: How do you correct for the sensor drift in values which is caused by the pattern of how the plates sensors are read.

Answear: calculate a z-score which is a statistical measurement that describes how many standard deviations a value is from the mean of a distribution. to calculate this I took used the following formulas.

Question 2: 

VL2 = sensor1
BL1 = sensor2

A = VL2/BL1

R(relative_Well_number) = well_number extracted digits + extracted well_number Alphebetic Letter mapped value

perform a liner regression to find the slope

S = R + A. In this equation, X is the explanatory variable and S is the dependent variable.

CS(corrected_slope) = A - (R * S)

M(mean) = ∑(CS) / number of CS

SD(standard_deviation) = √[(∑(CS)2 /n) - (∑CS/n)2]

NSD = number of standard deviations (set at 1.5)

CO(cuttoff_value) = M + (NSD * SD)

CM(corrected_mean) = ∑(CO) / number of CO

CSD(corrected_standard_deviation) = √[(∑(CO)2 /n) - (∑CO/n)2]

Z-score = CO - (CM/CSD)

Z-score-hits = CO < -5

# Future Work
* Item 1: adopt more user flexibility in file and graph generation to allow this analysis program to be useful beyond this drug analysis expiriment.
* Item 2: adopt an inheritance style structure for my utility classes to reduce redundancy 
* Item 3: adopt an less hard coded approach to the generation methods to reduce redundancy
